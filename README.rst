Finder
=========================================

Finder is a web service that aims for parity with Gatherer search features.

Features:

*   **Direct porting of gatherer uri format** - If you're currently scraping gatherer with custom searches, porting is as simple as pointing your queries at a different domain *(and adding an api key)*

*   **Custom data hydration** Why load artist name or collector's number if you don't use them?  Specify the attributes you want filled.

*   **Paginated APIs** - Unless you like everything at once.  That's fine too.
